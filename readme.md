# Custom Resume Builder

This is a custom resume builder application that allows users to create their own resumes by filling out various input fields.

## Usage

1. Fill out the input fields with the relevant information for your resume.
2. Click the "Preview" button to toggle between the input fields and the generated resume preview.
3. In the preview mode, you can see a preview of your resume with the entered information.
4. To print the resume, click the "Print Resume" button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- CKEditor

## How It Works

1. The application uses CKEditor to provide a rich text editing experience for the "work experience" and "academics" input fields.
2. When the user clicks the "Preview" button, the input fields are hidden, and the entered information is displayed in a formatted manner as a resume preview.
3. The resume preview includes sections for the name, title, objective, skills, achievements, contact information, work experience, academic details, and projects.
4. The "Print Resume" button allows the user to print the generated resume.

Feel free to customize and modify the code according to your needs.
